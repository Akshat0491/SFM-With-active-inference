This was an attempt to implement Active Inference SFM for bidisperse models. It uses states based on a 'conflict' parameter, described in detail in the notebook this repo contains.

A thing that's realised eventually is that this model is not mcuh differrent fom other utility maximisation models. This is because a deterministic observation model is implemented in the sense that agents can directly observe the states they are in. 
this way, this current implementation is not per say more robust than other utility maximisation models, however, it is an interesting model from utility maximisation pov.
